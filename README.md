# Get Weather App

This app returns a description of the current weather and the temperature in C or F, based on the user inputting a city and selecting units. It is calling the OpenWeather API at https://openweathermap.org/current.

## React
The React app runs on localhost:3000 and can be started with yarn start.

## Express
The Express server runs on localhost:3001 and can be started with npm run server.

### Tests

There is currently no testing but I will be adding this soon.
